✅ This version is **short, neat, and easy to follow**.  
It’s perfect for GitHub so anyone can clone and run with **`flutter run`**.  

If you want, I can **also make a version with nice emojis + color hints for operators**, so it looks like an **iPhone-style README**.  

Do you want me to do that?
